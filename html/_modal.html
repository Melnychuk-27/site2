            Research is "creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge".[1] It involves 
            the collection, organization, and analysis of information to increase understanding of a topic or issue. A 
            research project may be an expansion on past work in the field. To test the validity of instruments, 
            procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole.
            The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, 
            interpretation, and the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human 
            knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between 
            humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic,
            [citation needed] social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc. The scientific
            tudy of research practices is known as meta-research.

        <div class="Documentation">
            Requirements documentation is the description of what a particular software does or shall do. It is used throughout development to 
            communicate how the software functions or how it is intended to operate. It is also used as an agreement or as the foundation for 
            agreement on what the software will do. Requirements are produced and consumed by everyone involved in the production of software, 
            including: end users, customers, project managers, sales, marketing, software architects, usability engineers, interaction designers, 
            developers, and testers.

        <div class="Development">
            Development (also real estate development, development; from the English real estate development "improvement, development of 
            real estate") is an entrepreneurial activity associated with the creation of a real estate object, reconstruction or change of an 
            existing building or land plot, leading to an increase in their value. [1] In Russian practice, two versions of the term have been 
            developed: real estate development (by analogy with the English language) and a short version - development, which has the same 
            meaning.

        <div class="Design">
            A design is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, 
            or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a prototype, product or process. The verb to design expresses the process 
            of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some 
            eering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and 
            constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a 
            certain environment. Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, 
            and sewing patterns.
